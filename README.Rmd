<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of velocimeter is to calculate terminal velocity using a physical model for free fall with air resistance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of velocimeter like so:

``` r
# Download the repository from GitHub
# https://github.com/jinleizhu/velocimeter
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(velocimeter)
calculate.terminal.velocity.phys(file = "terminal_velocity_analysis20219191543/agri-short_00000.aviResults.txt",
                                 min.size = 10,min.circularity = 0.05,fps = 130,tubelength = 1.075)

```
